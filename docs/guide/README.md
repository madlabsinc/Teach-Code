# teachcode

> Learn to code effectively.

## How it works

The user is provided with 30 tasks guiding them through the basic constructs of a preferred programming language. He/she gets a key to access the next task if the current task meets all the test cases. There is also the provision to revisit previously submitted tasks, but it can't be worked on again.

- Navigate to a directory of your choice and fire in `teachcode init`.
- Navigate to the `teachcode-solutions` directory.
- Copy and paste the command as instructed within the initial screen `teachcode fetchtask {key}`.
- Hurray :tada: you've got your first task.
- Write your solution within a file that is auto-created. For instance, `task{task_number}.py` for Python.
- teachcode submit submits the current solution and gives you the next key to proceed if your solution meets all the test cases.
- `teachcode showkeys` shows you all the keys.
- `teachcode showcommands` shows you all the commands available for reference.
