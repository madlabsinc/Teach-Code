# teachcode

> Brush up your programming skills right from the terminal.

## How it works

Users are required to solve 30 tasks that take them through the basic constructs of the programming language of their choice. The tasks are designed in such a way that the complexity increases as users progress through the tasks. One can't move forward until the current task is completed. Previously submitted tasks can be viewed if he/she wants but can't be worked on again.

- `teachcode` expects you to have a GitHub account. Make sure that you create one if that's not the case.
- Navigate to the directory of your choice and type in `teachcode init`. After typing the command, the following window would appear in your terminal

<br />

- Select the language of your choice and follow the instructions as prompted.

- After entering your Github user token, you would get the following screen. Now type in `cd teachcode-solutions` followed by `teachcode fetchtask`.

<br />

- Hurray :tada: , you've got your first task.
- Now you can find a `config.json` and `task1.py` (language of choice) file within the `teachcode-solutions` directory.

- Now type in `teachcode submit`.
- Enter your Git credentials when prompted.
- If the current solution satisfies all test cases, you'll get the key to proceed farther.
- Now type in `teachcode fetchtask`.
- Solve all 30 question, to complete the task

_In case you want to revisit any of the previously submitted tasks, grab the associated key by typing in `teachcode showkeys` followed by `teachcode fetchtask <key>`_

- That's all folks, good luck :+1:
