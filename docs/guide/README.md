# teachcode

> Learn to code effectively.

## How it works

Users are required to solve 30 tasks that take them through the basic constructs of the programming language of their choice. The tasks are designed in such a way that the complexity increases as users progress through the tasks. Users can't move forward until the current task is completed (since the progress is determined by a unique key that is generated upon successful completion). Previously submitted tasks can be viewed as desired by the user but can't be worked on again.

- `teachcode` expects you to have a GitHub account. Make sure that you create one if that's not the case.
- Navigate to the directory of your choice and type in `teachcode init`. After typing the command, the following window would appear in your terminal

- Select the language of your choice and follow the instructions as prompted.
