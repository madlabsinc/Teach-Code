# teachcode

> Learn to code effectively.

## How it works

Users are required to solve 30 tasks that take them through the basic constructs of the programming language of their choice. The tasks are designed in such a way that the complexity increases as users progress through the tasks. Users can't move forward until the current task is completed (since the progress is determined by a unique key that is generated upon successful completion). Previously submitted tasks can be viewed as desired by the user but can't be worked on again.

- `teachcode` expects you to have a GitHub account. Make sure that you create one if that's not the case.
- Navigate to the directory of your choice and type in `teachcode init`.
- Follow the instructions as prompted.
- Now type in `cd teachcode-solutions`.
- Grab the initial key and type in `teachcode fetchtask <key>`.
- Hurray, :tada: you've got your first task.
- Now you can find a `config.json` and `task1.py` (language of choice) file within the `teachcode-solutions` directory.
- Open up your favorite editor and code up the solution.
- Now type in `teachcode submit`.
- Enter your Git credentials when prompted.
- If the current solution satisfies all test cases, you'll get the key to proceed farther.
- Grab the key and type in `teachcode fetchtask <key>`.
