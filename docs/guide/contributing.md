# Contributing

## Guidelines

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Now install the dependencies with `npm install`
4. Create a symlink with `npm link` which enables `teachcode` to be accessed globally.
5. Make your desired changes.
6. Make sure that you run `npm run lint` eventhough there is a `pre-commit` hook configured for the purpose.
7. If everything seems to be fine locally, you may push it to the remote repository by switching to another branch and proposing a Pull Request to the base fork.


## Points to ponder

1. Make sure that you submit an issue first if you have something in mind that you're willing to work on.
2. Follow a `rebase` strategy inorder to update your remote branch with the latest changes.
3. Prefix your branch names with `feat/` or `bugfix/` as per the case.
