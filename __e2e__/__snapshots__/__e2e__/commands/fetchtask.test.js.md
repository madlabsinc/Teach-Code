     Now lets focus on variables␊
     Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.␊
     Also consider these variable naming conventions␊
    ␊
     1.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character␊
     2.A variable name cannot start with a number␊
     3.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )␊
     3.Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)␊
     Task 2:-␊
     Consider these variable names:-␊
     variable␊
     sum@␊
     product_of_12␊
     12_product␊
     Just print out the correct variable names in order␊

    Awesome! Let's move on to Comparison Operators. They are used to compare two values. They return true or false according to the value of their operands. They are: ==, ===, !=, >, <, >=, <=. Here's your task:␊
     Task 6:-␊
     Use 44 & 29 as your operands. Compare them using the Comparison operators in the same order and print the value which they return.␊
